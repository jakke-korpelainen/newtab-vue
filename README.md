# newtab-vue

Locally hosted alternative for a New Tab -page for Browsers. Developed for personal use. Decided to remake with Vue the one I made previously with React. Created using vue-loader, links at the bottom below.

## Features/Tech 
- Local time & date (using moment)
- Forecast from OpenWeatherMap,
- Randomized background for your query (e.g. cities) from Unsplash API

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
